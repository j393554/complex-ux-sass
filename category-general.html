          <h3>A man's wish to his children</h3>

          <p>Published on <time datetime="2019-06-11">11 June, 2019</time></p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>A man spoke to each of his 3 sons when he sent them off to college&hellip;</p>
            <p>"I feel it's my duty to provide you with the best possible education, and you do not owe me anything for that.  However, I want you to appreciate it.  As a token, please each put $1,000 into my coffin when I die."</p>
            <p>And so it happened.  His sons became a doctor, a lawyer and a financial planner, each very successful financially.  When their father's time had come, and they saw their father in the coffin, they remembered his wish.</p>
            <p>First, the doctor put 10 newly printed crisp $100 bills onto the chest of the deceased.</p>
            <p>Then, the financial planner also put $1,000 there in 20 newly printed crisp $50 bills.</p>
            <p>Finally, it was the heartbroken lawyer's turn.  He reached into his pocket, took out his checkbook, wrote a check for $3,000, put it into his father's coffin, and took the $2,000 cash.</p>
            <p>The lawyer is now running for Congress, possibly in your district.</p>

          <h3>Frog calls out an Engineer</h3>

          <p>Published on <time datetime="2019-06-10">10 June, 2019</time></p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>He bent over, picked up the frog, and put it in his pocket. The frog spoke up again and said, "If you kiss me, I'll turn back into a beautiful princess and stay with you for one week". The engineer took the frog out of his pocket, smiled at it and returned it to the pocket. The frog then cried out, "If you kiss me and turn me back into a princess, I'll stay with you for one week and do anything you want". Again, the engineer took the frog out, smiled at it and put it back into his pocket. Finally, the frog asked, "What is the matter? I've told you I'm a beautiful princess and that I'll stay with you for one week and do anything you want. Why won't you kiss me?"</p>
            <p>The engineer said, "Look , I'm an engineer. I don't have time for a girlfriend, but a talking frog - now that's cool".</p>
